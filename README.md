# PixelBattles
Battle it out with an array of pixelated characters with many weapons, while also avoiding the dangerous creatures of Wonder World.





## Controls and Gameplay

At the moment, this only has keyboard controls.

`A` or `Left Arrow Key` - Walk left

`D` or `Right Arrow Key` - Walk right

`S` or `Up Arrow Key` - Jump

`Space` - Punch (a rather usless punch at the moment)

### Platforms

All the ground blocks in the game pretty much are just platforms that can only be used for ground than for walls.


### The CPU Fighter

There is a little CPU fighter that tries to chase you down. He doesn't acutally do anything when he catches up with you at the moment.


### Rooms

You may notice the CPU player walking into one of the brick walls while trying to get to you, and disappear. Or maybe your waiting for him, then he just pops out of the ground for a suprise attack. That is a room. When you walk through a wall that hides other fighters, you'll be able to see all the fighters and platforms hiding in that room while also not being able to see the outside world as well.
